*A cola is drawn every day. But will the algorithm know?*

This is a race. Man vs machine. 

Who can draw the best Cola after 1000 days? 

Follow @_daily_cola on Instagram for the man. 

Follow @_daily_cola_AI for the AI. 

Follow @_repost_daily_cola for the bored. 


This project uses a developer API key from Facebook to get all instagram posts from an account. All images are processed and a GAN network attempts to generate a new image based on the images from the connected account. Regarding who lost, man vs. machine, in this project one could argue both or none.
